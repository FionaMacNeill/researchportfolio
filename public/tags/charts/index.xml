      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew that all of that work that I did on polls would come in handy at some point. The &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; arrived, as displaying data was something that seemed important from the beginning, to support the goals for the project. I wanted to support the information about &amp;lsquo;UK smart device ownership&amp;rsquo; with some data. Having spent quite a bit of time 
 and trying things out, I felt sure that the the Google Charts api (n.d.) would give me the level of interactivity and customisation required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;something-i-changed&#34;&gt;Something I changed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the tools I had used already (see earlier entries including Flickity by metafizzy (2016), smooth-scroll by cfernandi (2016)) the instructions always say to call the JavaScript package in the header. This is something that my instructor, Marcus, had pointed out as bad practice. Therefore, I created a new eventlistener in my JavaScript file in order to load google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;loader.js&amp;rdquo; script. This allowed me to place the &lt;script&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;script&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/script&gt;&amp;rsquo; tag at the bottom of my index.html file. However, unlike the other widgets and code snippets that I have used, I cannot compile Google&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript as part of my own script (Google, 2016a), it has to be loaded from Google servers (licensed under Apache license version 2.0 (2004) ). For this reason I reused the loading GIF from the contact form, to show while the chart loads. The data itself is from Offcom&amp;rsquo;s report entitled, The Communications Market, 5 Internet and Online Content (2016a, p. 191). What is great about their site is that they make the raw data available in Microsoft Excel format, so I was able to construct the chart based on a subset of data (Ofcom, 2016b). In order to show the age versus ownership I selected a stacked barchart as a space efficient way to show the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prepping-the-chart-for-print&#34;&gt;Prepping the chart for print&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have still to create my print stylesheet, which is something that I will do towards the end of the project. In the meantime it made sense to make sure that the chart was prepped for printing to png. I am not going to make a link to the png available as that function will run in browsers which support the HTML5 &lt;script&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;canvas&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/script&gt; element (Google, 2016c). However, what customising this script did do, was create a static view of the chart showing it in suitable format for printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tab-clear&#34;&gt;Tab clear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I needed to highlight the User Experience section of the portfolio page design, as it was all very wordy. There is still a lot to consider in this area, but I decided to add a tab image on the top-left of the UX factors (formerly scenarios) section. I started by creating an svg, partially inspired by a post on CSS-Tricks (Coyier, 2013). However, I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with it in terms of formatting and scaling. For now I have replaced it with a tab which I created using pure CSS. The tab is actually made of two divs, one for the the main tab shape (rounded rectangle) and one for the slant leading up to it using the skewX transform option. However, I will have to replace this as it is only compatible with IE11 or later (Can I use, 2016). It is a shame, but it was good to learn about the transform option and again I used the ::before pseudo element to add text content on the div.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 Second attempt at a tab using two CSS divs - one skewed 40deg - sadly it will need to be replaced due to the need for background compatibility&lt;/p&gt;
\[/caption\]&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, I will need to go back to an svg solution, but I will draw it to look like what I came up with using the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
