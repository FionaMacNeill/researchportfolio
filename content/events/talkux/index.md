In 2025, LTUX Brighton hosted the international conference for [Ladies that UX](https://ladiesthatux.com/), [Talk UX](https://www.talk-ux.com/). We hosted 32 speakers and panelists over two days and received amazing feedback. 

Personally, Talk UX was one of the most challenging, yet fulfilling experiences of my life. It really warrants it's own blog post, particularly because we tried to make the event as responsible and sustainable as we could. As organisers we considered this in terms of how we organised, resourcing (both in-person and digital), and environmental impact. 

I grew both in so many ways as a person, as a designer, as a leader, and as a business leader through the experience. I will be forever thankful for the vision, belief, and trust or our organising group and everything we achieved together. 

This marked the end of my chapter leadership of LTUX Brighton. I'm staying on as treasurer as we move into next phase of our development as a group.
