I'm planning a series of blog posts about this talk as there is a *lot* of thinking behind 'Creating Another Way'. It is a longterm work-in-progress! If you are wondering about Obsidian, find out more about their [fantastic notetaking tool at their site](https://obsidian.md/). I am a long-term fan.
