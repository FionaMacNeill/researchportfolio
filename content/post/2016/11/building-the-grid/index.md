After starting my initial experiments/prototypes for the portfolio project from a boilerplate I decided that I wanted to build my own responsive CSS grid from scratch. TheÂ grid turned out fairly well although there are some very slight issues with the column alignment which I need to sort out. I also still need to add the mobile device break points. I did find it very helpful to make use of the CSS calc() function to actively resize widths in percentages based on window size (calc()., 2016). This is a fantastic function although the support for it isn't universal yet (82.73 according to caniuse.com). Having said that I did try my grid in Safari to see how it behaved in an unsupported browser and I was pleased with how well it resized. \[caption id="attachment\_200" align="alignnone" width="919"\][![Screenshot showing the issue with column alignment](images/gridalignissue.png)](http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/2016/11/22/building-the-grid/gridalignissue/) The coloured overlay is included to highlight the issue with the column alignment.\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_202" align="alignnone" width="613"\][![Screenshot showing the grid system with a photoshop grid/guides overlaid](images/fixthegridalignissue.png)](http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/2016/11/22/building-the-grid/fixthegridalignissue/) I will attempt to use the power of Photoshop to fix my mathematics - here is a newly sized grid overlay using Photoshop guides to figure out the correct calculations.\[/caption\] Just putting these calculations here for future reference. **Columns:** Columns = 12 Gutter = 15px **Rows:** Rows = 12 Gutter = 15px **Margins:** Top = 10px Left = 20px Bottom = 10px Right = 20px
