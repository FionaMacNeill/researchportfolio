## Introduction

In February I shall be starting an MSc in User Experience Design and as a consequence my thoughts have turned to the study tools, which I wish to make use of as a student. As part of this process I have been considering my arsenal of apps. I'll likely talk about the full extent of my app choice plotting in future posts. In this post I shall provide my reflections on notetaking apps in-particular. In my experience early preparation has always been the best strategy when considering any new academic venture, so I look forward to sharing some of my findings on this blog in the lead up to and during my forthcoming period of study. 

## Productivity and notetaking apps that I use

In my professional life I have become a devotee of [Evernote](https://evernote.com "Evernote website"). I was not by any means an early adopter or rather I was but I got burned by a glitch circa 2009 which resulted in the loss on my web-based notes (at that time using it in-browser). I must stress that such a loss is not likely to happen with Evernote now but back then it was a relatively new thing and when on the cutting edge you may occasionally experience virtual paper cuts (thankfully I only lost a few notes)! However last year Evernote won my heart again when I decided that I wanted a solution with note tagging (keywords), multi-platform compatibility (in my case, Mac, PC, iOS, Android) and OCR capabilities (text recognition). After looking at a few app-based solutions it was the only option which gave me the flexibility I was craving. In my work I have come to rely on Evernote as an excellent option for recording meetings and consultations, being able to send a record of what was discussed and any actions to a staff person immediately after the meeting. I then link this information to my to-dos in [Trello](https://trello.com "Trello website") (I'll write about the wonders of Trello some other time). Sometimes when I'm particularly busy I quickly jot ideas or tasks down on paper and then use Evernote's document capture function to take a photo. I am always impressed by the OCR capabilities of Evernote when it comes to recognising my squiggly handwriting and making it searchable (the detects words in handwriting rather than converting handwriting to type). Also when you add in the photo annotation tools made possible through Evenote's partner app [Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/ "Skitch App") I am one happy customer. But...and you knew that this was coming, there is something to be said for handwriting and when it comes to deeper notetaking and truly learning concepts; I personally need to write concepts down to retain and understand them. When the iPad first came out in 2010 (Apple, 2010). 

## Handwriting in apps

### File management

I was an early adopter and one of the first apps I fell in love with was [Penultimate](https://evernote.com/penultimate/ "Penultimate app site"). This app lets you draw or write with a stylus or your finger in virtual notebooks, later they added being able to add photos and voila it became a virtual sketchbook! I no longer wanted to carry a moleskin and an iPad and for a while Penultimate served me well for quick notetaking. Penultimate was acquired by Evernote in 2012 (Libin, 2012) and with that came the OCR capability of being able to 'search' your handwritten notes. However there were three functions which I have always felt are missing from Penultimate app which eventually caused me to abandon it. The first is the absence of a adequate notebook file management system, in apps like [Goodreader](http://www.goodiware.com "Goodreader site"), [iAnnotatePDF](http://www.branchfire.com/iannotate/#makepaperjealous "iAnnotatePDF site") and [Notability](http://www.gingerlabs.com "Notability site - Gingerlabs"), although more strictly for annotation of imported files, these apps allowed a far superior filing system. For example in iAnnotatePDF you can tag files with keywords, create folders and connect to Sharepoint (MyFiles) via WebDAV for backup purposes. In Penultimate, you just have an ever growing pile of notebooks.

### Background colour

The second issue is the background colour, from my [previous post](/post/2014/09/the-adjustment-bureau/ "The Adjustment Bureau: The Case for Adjustment in Mobile Apps") you'll know that background colour is very important to my efficiency when reading and writing. You do have the option of importing a photo to use as a background, so in theory that is a workaround and you can purchase notepaper types from Evernote Market, there are some good ones but these are more to do with line based layouts than page background colour. I have also found this [enterprising site](http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1 "iPadPapers site") which allows you to create your own templates for Penultimate as well as use templates which other's have created, in particular I was happy to find a [Cornell Notes format](http://lsc.cornell.edu/LSC_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf "Cornell PDF tutorial") template after the recent [MELSIG](http://melsig.shu.ac.uk/?page_id=645 "MELSIG event page") presentation about it. With any drawing/handwriting app, as a workaround, you could draw a template on the page, but then it becomes tricky when you need to cut and paste your written sections as the background gets confused with your written content.

![Notes Plus shows the list of background colours avaialble for selection.](images/NotesPlus_Backgroundcolours-2k8wz3p.jpg "Notes Plus - the background colours and template options available in Notes Plus.") 

### On-screen wrist protector

The third issue is the lack of an adjustable on-screen wrist protector. Penultimate allows you to define your wrist position but as you will see from the image below, it has trouble deciding which marks my stylus is making and which marks my wrist is making. This was the deal-breaker, I'd be mid-flow in writing and half of what I'd written would fail to show up as in Penultimate's view my wrist had been doing the writing!

![penultimate app with handwriting and wrist created scribbles shown](images/penultimate_wrist-183un00.jpg "Penultimate - the effect of wrist shown.")  Cornell Notes template shown above from [iPadPapers.com](http://ipadpapers.com/tag.asp?tag=1 "iPadPapers.com")

So after four years of on and off trial and error, with periodic abandonment of the idea of handwriting on my iPad other than using very helpful PDF annotation apps for small comments (another post about these apps specifically in the future), I think that I have finally come up with my ideal list of functions which a handwriting app needs - and one app fits almost all of them - Notes Plus with Notability taking a close second place. 

## My ideal list of functions

- **File management** and ideally creation of folders or notebooks for storage of different note types
- **Background page colour** and template adjustment
- Adjustable ****on-screen wristguard****
    
 ![iAnnotatePDF wristguard as a grey bar at the bottom of the screen](images/iAnnotatePDF_wristguard-15uevmj.jpg "iAnnotatePDF - this is a pretty typical wristguard which you can adjust downward as you fill the page. A simple thing, but important.") 

- **Good** **virtual ink flow**
- **Ink customisation and style**
- **Two-fingered scroll and zoom** support
- **Easy drag and drop** customisation of already written text
- Dropbox and/or WebDAV **backup** support - just in case
- Hand-drawn **shape recognition** - I draw a circle or square and the app tidies it up for me automatically
- **Close-up mode** - I not good at keeping to the lines or within box areas otherwise due to my squiggly writing
    
    
## Two Examples of Close-up mode
    
**Notes Plus**
![Notes Plus Ink customisation options](images/NotesPlus_closeup-28urc98.jpg "Also shows the excellent Ink customisation options.") 
    
**Notability**
![Notability close-up writing mode](images/Notability_closeup-2aso0t3.jpg "Notability - close-up writing mode. Both Notes Plus and Notability have great navigation tools within the close-up pane.")
    
- **Audio memos** - for when my writing isn't fast enough!
- **Presentation mode**: can this app be shown in a classroom, to demonstrate annotation or to draw quick diagrams?
- Good **tutorial materials** to make the most of the app
    - **Bonus:**
        - **PDF and word doc import** - is it an annotation app too!
        - **Layers** - 'send to back' and locking options
        - Built-in **Cornell Notes** template
        - **Handwriting to text converter** (!) - in app purchase available in Notes Plus
            

**Handwriting to Text Converter in Notes Plus**

![Handwritten text is selected by drawing around it](images/NotesPlus_convert1-1kwmxrr.jpg "Select the text by drawing a circle around it. Select the conversion option.")

## Analysis           

I analysed four apps based on these criteria: Notes Plus, Notability, iAnnotatePDF and Penultimate. The results are below, I have awarded 2 point for each "X", the "+" signs indicate exemplary functionality. Bonus features are not counted towards possible total of 26. 

**New:** Notability have just released a [companion app for for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability/id736189492?mt=12).

## Conclusion

For written notes Notes Plus wins hands-down and it is also superb for combining PDFs, Word documents and written notes into self-contained notebooks or virtual binders. I have resolved to use it for the purpose of textbook related notes over the next few months. I'll report back on how it goes. For decent notetaking and excellent PDF annotation Notability has clear benefits. iAnnotatePDF's clear advantage over the other apps is its excellent file management  system and also the ability to place audio comments in context within a document.
