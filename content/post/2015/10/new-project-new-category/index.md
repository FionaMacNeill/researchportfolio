## Well almost... 

I have had a #UX category on this blog for a while, but I have decided to formalise it as I embark on a grad school module, _Interaction Design and Evaluation Process._ The UX category will be a place to collectÂ my thoughts in relation to what I learn on the module and can be viewed in a collated format via the "UX" tab. Things to comment on this week:

- Read and think about **BS EN ISO 9241-210-2010 - Ergonomics of human-system interaction**
- Read and comment on user profiles and personae
- Read and comment on Scenarios

All of this will also feed into my personal research project, looking at analyses of #IoT systems. See you soon!
