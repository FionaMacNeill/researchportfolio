location: Online

summary: An online workshop presented by Caroline Jarrett (Effortmark Ltd), Bukola Julugbo (Joshua's Army), and Fiona MacNeill (Ladies that UX Brighton [volunteer])
abstract: 'In service design, we often aim to replace an outdated set of paper forms with an easy-to-use digital service. How can we make sure that our new digital forms are accessible? 

In this workshop, weâ€™ll focus on a specific question to explore the new WCAG 2.1 guidelines (September 23), see whether the GOV.UK design system can help us, and then create a first draft prototype.

Based on the workshop co-designed by Caroline Jarrett and Ladies that UX Brighton in 2023 - [workshop overview](https://www.notion.so/ladiesthatux/Accessible-Online-Forms-58483db044ea4ecb9c307a2e4447140c?pvs=4).'
