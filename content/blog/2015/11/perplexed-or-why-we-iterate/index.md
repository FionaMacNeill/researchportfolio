I have a confession to make, I am pretty perplexed by Unified Modeling Language (UML). If you were to look at this blog, based on the lack of posts, you wouldn't think that I had made any progress over the past two weeks. We covered User Conceptual Modeling as a topic in class back on the 6th of November and in my last post on the 11th, I made the grand proclamation that I would complete my UML diagram by Friday (13th). Well I did create a UML diagram, and then I created another iteration and another; I became obsessed with understanding the syntax...not a healthy obsession, but a frustrating one. During the past week I tried to read everything that I could in order to aid my understanding. Tonight I came to the realisation that Learning Objects are pretty hard to build in UML. I also made the decision to leave this part of the project for now and move on to writing some commentary on user requirements. I feel that by moving on, I may miss some error in the system design, but also if I continue to work on the diagram I am going to stall my progress further. This was paralleled early on in the other project that I am working on at the moment, where I attempted to create a diagram for a hypothetical wearable device as part of the Internet of Things. Four-plus iterations later I finally have something that resembles the operation of a real system. To summarise here is what I have learned from this road-block:

- step away from the diagram;
- perspective can only be capitalised upon by making some space between yourself and the problem and then walking back towards it;
- Make like Andy Warhol, and iterate;
- Allow for frustration time - cook on a medium heat and allow to simmer.

Until next time... P.s. I am leaving this note here because these diagrams need a glossary. 

**Here is the first iteration of the model:**
![A very blocky UML model where almost all of the actions are crammed into one container - a rooky mistake](images/UML%20diagram%20IDM21.webp) 

**And here is the most recent, albeit not entirely finished:**
![A far clearer visual taxonomy has emerged in this version with clearer relatioships and separation between the different functions, example functions include: status, topics, progress](images/V2%20UML%20diagram%20IDM21.webp)

**Version completed on 05/12/15**

![Version 5 of the model shows user states including returning and forgotten password/username this is a far more accomplished map of the inner workings of the application using the block based structure of UML](images/V5%20UML%20diagram%20IDM21.webp)
